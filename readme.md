This is a simple program to convert NYJC timetables to .ics calendar files.
The program is a runnable program and will require the index_ex.php file from nyxchange website. This can be downloaded by using network monitor in most browsers (f12)

This program depends on biweekly and its dependencies.

Due to the timetable being changed to weekly, a Weekly branch is created for the updated code.
